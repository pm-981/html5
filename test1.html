    <br>
    <br>As of the last few days the majority of Manchester United fans have been in dreamland. One of their greatest ever players is back.
    <br>Cristiano Ronaldo is once again a Manchester United player - 12 years on from ending his six-year trophy-laden spell there.
    <br>In his first spell at Old Trafford, Ronaldo arrived as a boy and left as a man under the tutelage of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.
    <br>The bond those two built remains as strong as ever. Rather than a manager and player relationship it's more akin to a father and son bond.
    <br>Speaking about why he re-signed for the club, Ronaldo was gushing in the role that Ferguson played.
    <br>
    <br>'As everybody knows, since I signed at 18, Sir Alex Ferguson was the key,' he told MUTV.

    <br>Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Cristiano Roanldo share a relationship akin to father and son
    <br>
    <br>'I remember when we played against Manchester when I was at Sporting Lisbon. For me, Sir Alex Ferguson is like a father in football for me. 
    <br>He helped me a lot, he taught me many things, and in my opinion of course he had a big role because the relationship that we had, 
    <br>we keep in touch all the time, and he's an unbelievable person.
    <br>'I really like him a lot and he was the main key for me to be in the position that I am, that I signed for Manchester United.'
    <br>These words followed an Instagram post which Ronaldo completed with the sign-off: 'Sir Alex, this one is for you…'
    <br><img src="人物1.jpg" alt="人物1" width="200px" align="center">
    <br>The story as to how Ronaldo came to United in 2003 from Sporting Lisbon is well-documented 
    <br>and in those following years Ferguson always looked to protect his star - whether 
    <br>that be while playing for Manchester United or if he was away from the club. 
    <br>During his early years Ronaldo was often criticised for being a 'one-trick pony' due to his excessive use of stepovers, 
    <br>and of being a 'diver', but Ferguson helped hone his craft.

    <br><strong>PASSAGE ONE</strong>
</p>

<br>
<br>
<body>

   <div class="f">
    <br>(1) Life can be tough for immigrants in America. As a Romanian bank clerk in Atlanta puts it, to find a good
    <br>job “you have to be like a wolf in the forest—able to smell out the best meat.” And if you can’t find work, don’t
   
    <br>expect the taxpayer to bail you out. Unlike in some European countries, it is extremely hard for an able-bodied
    <br>immigrant to live off the state.A law passed in 1996 explicitly bars most immigrants, even those with legal status,
    <br>from receiving almost any federal benefits.
    <br>
    <br>(2) That is one reason why America absorbs immigrants better than many other rich countries, according to a
    <br>new study by the University of California. The researchers sought to measure the effect of immigration on the
    <br>native-born in 20 rich countries, taking into account differences in skills between immigrants and natives, imperfect
    <br>labor markets and the size of the welfare state in each country.
    <br>
    
    <br>
    <div class="di">
        <br>(3) Their results offer ammunition for fans of more open borders. In 19 out of 20 countries, the authors
    <br>calculated that shutting the doors entirely to foreign workers would make the native-born worse off. Never mind
    <br>what it would do to the immigrants themselves, who benefit far more than anyone else from being allowed to cross
    <br>borders to find work.
    </div>
    <br>(4) The study also suggests that most countries could handle more immigration than they currently allow.
    <br>In America,a one-percentage point increase in the proportion of immigrants in the population made the native-born
    <br>0.05% better off. The opposite was true in some countries with generous or ill-designed welfare states, however.A
    <br>one-point rise in immigration made the native-born slightly worse off in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg,
    <br>the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. In Belgium, immigrants who lose jobs can receive almost two-thirds of
    <br>their most recent wage in state benefits, which must make the hunt for a new job less urgent.
    <br>
    <br>(5) None of these effects was large, but the study undermines the claim that immigrants steal jobs from
    <br>natives or drag down their wages. Many immigrants take jobs that Americans do not want, the study finds. This
    <br>“smooths” the labor market and ultimately creates more jobs for locals. Native-owned grocery stores do better
    <br>business because there are immigrants to pick the fruit they sell. Indian computer scientists help American software
    
    <br>firms expand.A previous study found that because immigrants typically earn less than locals with similar skills,
    <br>they boost corporate profits, prompting companies to grow and hire more locals.

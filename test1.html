<br>
<br>In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each multiple choice question, 
<br>there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. 
<br> Choose the one that you think is the
<br>best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

    <br>(1) Life can be tough for immigrants in America. As a Romanian bank clerk in Atlanta puts it, to find a good
    <br>job “you have to be like a wolf in the forest—able to smell out the best meat.” And if you can’t find work, don’t

    <br>expect the taxpayer to bail you out. Unlike in some European countries, it is extremely hard for an able-bodied
    <br>immigrant to live off the state.A law passed in 1996 explicitly bars most immigrants, even those with legal status,
    <br>from receiving almost any federal benefits.
    <br>
    <br>(2) That is one reason why America absorbs immigrants better than many other rich countries, according to a
    <br>new study by the University of California. The researchers sought to measure the effect of immigration on the
    <br>native-born in 20 rich countries, taking into account differences in skills between immigrants and natives, imperfect
    <br>labor markets and the size of the welfare state in each country.
    <br>
    <br>(3) Their results offer ammunition for fans of more open borders. In 19 out of 20 countries, the authors
    <br>calculated that shutting the doors entirely to foreign workers would make the native-born worse off. Never mind
    <br>what it would do to the immigrants themselves, who benefit far more than anyone else from being allowed to cross
    <br>borders to find work.
    <br>

    <br>(4) The study also suggests that most countries could handle more immigration than they currently allow.
    <br>In America,a one-percentage point increase in the proportion of immigrants in the population made the native-born
    <br>0.05% better off. The opposite was true in some countries with generous or ill-designed welfare states, however.A
    <br>one-point rise in immigration made the native-born slightly worse off in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg,
    <br>the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. In Belgium, immigrants who lose jobs can receive almost two-thirds of
    <br>their most recent wage in state benefits, which must make the hunt for a new job less urgent.
    <br>
    <br>(5) None of these effects was large, but the study undermines the claim that immigrants steal jobs from
    <br>natives or drag down their wages. Many immigrants take jobs that Americans do not want, the study finds. This
    <br>“smooths” the labor market and ultimately creates more jobs for locals. Native-owned grocery stores do better
    <br>business because there are immigrants to pick the fruit they sell. Indian computer scientists help American software

    <br>firms expand.A previous study found that because immigrants typically earn less than locals with similar skills,
    <br>they boost corporate profits, prompting companies to grow and hire more locals.
</body>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Increase in immigration in Austria fails to improve locals’ life mainly because of________.</strong> 
<br>[A] low wages for locals    [B] imperfect labor markets
<br>[C] the design of the welfare system   [D] inadequate skills of immigrants
<br>
<br><strong>2. Who will favor the study results by researchers from the University of California?</strong>
<br>[A] People who have legal status.  [B] People who run businesses
<br>[C] People who receive state benefits.   [D] People who are willing to earn less.
<br>
<br><strong>3. It can be inferred from the passage that the author’s attitude toward immigrant is________.</strong>
<br>[A] cautiously favorable [B] slightly negative
<br>[C] strongly negative [D] quite ambiguous
